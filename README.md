# Rena

Rena - is a project creation utility that I wrote as an exercise to learn Golang a little. Rena is simle: it copies everything from your input directory to the output directory and also inserts your custom data along the way.


## Examples

Go to `examples` for... well... examples, duh.

```bash
./build/Rena_0.0.1 -o ./examples/aspdotnet/output --cfg ./examples/aspdotnet/.rena.yaml -i ./examples/aspdotnet/input
```
